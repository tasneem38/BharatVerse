The construction of the Qutub Minar was initiated by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate, in 1199 AD. He could only complete the basement. The next three storeys were added by his son-in-law and successor, Iltutmish. The topmost storey was damaged by lightning in 1368 and was rebuilt by Firoz Shah Tughlaq, who added another storey.

In the courtyard of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque stands the famous Iron Pillar, which bears a Sanskrit inscription in Gupta script. This pillar has puzzled scientists because it has not rusted despite being exposed to the elements for over 1600 years.
